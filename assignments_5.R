# Exercises in aggregating and subsetting data
# 

#############
# 1) Let's continue working with the population data. Read the population data into a data frame.


#############
# 2) Create two variables which indicate municipalities
#
# a) with a largish population (> 50 000) vs. those with a small population
# b) with an increasing population vs. a decreasing population.



############
# 3) Using ddply, calculate some descriptive statistics like mean, standard deviation and frequency
# for:
#
#
# a) large and small cities
# b) those with increasing and descreasing population
# c) for all four categories, large with increasing pop, large with decreasing pop etc.

# 4) Find out the equation for the standard error of mean (SEM). Then 
# modify the ddply-calls above to include it.
