# Exercises in using latent variable models
#

###############
# In these excercises, we'll work the bfi dataset included in the psych package. 
# It is about personality measurements based on the big five instrument. 

###############
# 1) Perform a parallel analysis on the data. What is the correct number of factors according to this analysis?

###############
#
# 2) Perform an EFA using the psych package. Choose an estimation method and a rotation method and justify your choices.
# Looking at the communality / uniqueness and complexity values, 
# which items seem not to measure a single underlying construct in this data set?


###############
#
# 3) Carry out a five-factor CFA using the lavaan package. Does the model fit the data according to the various fit indices? 



###############
#
#4) Examine the lack of model fit by producing plots of residual correlations using the qgraph package.
