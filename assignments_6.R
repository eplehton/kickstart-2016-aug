#####
# 1) Load dataset sleep from the R dataset repository using command data(sleep).
#    Get accustomed to the data. What are the variables? What do they represent?


#####
# 2) Create different kinds of plots, using both boxplot and ggplot2, to describe the
# differences between the two drugs. 

######
# 3) Test the difference between the two drugs to extra hours of sleep using 
# Student's paired t-test.

### 
# 4) The data is in long format. Reshape the data to wide format, so the two observations
# from the same participant (denoted with variable group) are on their own variables. 

###
# 5) Create a scatter plot where the extra hours for drug 1 are on the x-axis, and
# the extra hours for drug 2 are on the y-axis. 


####
# 6) Load the game data from file kr_gameraw.txt. 
#
# Calculate the accuracy of responses for each participant. See the lecture notes (rmANOVA.html) 
# how to calculate it. 

####
# 7) Make a plot which describes the level of accuracy by age group and gender. 
# Run ANOVA 2 x 2 to investigate if there are differences in accuracy as a function of age group or gender, 
# weather there is interaction of age group and gender?

####
# 8) In the lecture notes the game was divided to three sets, and then we investigated the learning 
# over the game. Perform a repeates measures ANOVA to investigate if the gender have 
# any significant effect on learning. This means that you need to investigate the interaction
# of set and gender. 

####
# 9) Refresh your memories from previous statistics courses. 
# Is everything right the repeated measures ANOVA you just performed? 
# Are we breaking any assumptions?
