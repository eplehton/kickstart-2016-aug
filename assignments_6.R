# Exercises in plotting data and using ggplot2
#

#####
# 1) Load the dataset "sleep" from the R dataset repository using the command "data(sleep)".
#    Get accustomed to the data. What are the variables? What do they represent?


#####
# 2) Create different kinds of plots, using both boxplot and ggplot2, to describe the
# differences between the two drugs. 

######
# 3) Do the two drugs have different effects on extra hours of sleep? Carry out 
# Student's paired t-test to investigate

### 
# 4) The data is in the long format. Reshape the data to wide format, so the two observations
# from the same participant (denoted with variable group) are on their own variables. 

###
# 5) Create a scatter plot where the extra hours for drug 1 are on the x-axis, and
# the extra hours for drug 2 are on the y-axis. 


####
# 6) Load the game data from file kr_gameraw.txt. 
#
# Calculate the accuracy of responses for each participant. See the lecture notes (rmANOVA.html) 
# for instructions on how to calculate it. 

############

# 7) Create a plot which describes the level of accuracy by age group and gender. 
# Run a 2 x 2 ANOVA to investigate if there are differences in accuracy as a function of age group or gender, 
# and whether there is an interaction effect for these two variables.


############
# 8) In the lecture notes the game was divided into three sets, and we investigated learning effects 
# over the course of the game. Perform a repeates measures ANOVA to investigate whether gender has 
# an effect on learning. This means that you need to investigate the interaction of set and gender. 

############
# 9) Refresh your memories from previous statistics courses. 
# Is everything right the repeated measures ANOVA you just performed? 
# Are we breaking any assumptions?
