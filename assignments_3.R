# Exercises in loading and subsetting data
# 

##############################
# 1) Load the academics data from the file academics_data.R or from one of the
# text files you created during the previous assignments. 

##############################
# 2) How could we ask for the summary of all variables for females?
# 
# Hint: Learn to solve the problems by dividing them into smaller subproblems:
# go step by step. First, solve the problem of subsetting the data frame so that 
# you'll have a new data frame consisting only of females. Then solve the problem 
# of describing the new data frame.

##############################
# 3) Are the salaries of the females and males in this sample of academics equal?
#

##############################
# 4) Load data from the file "Population_in_Finland.csv" into a new data frame.
#
# Hint: The file contains a title and some metadata in the beginning of the file.
# Use the parameter "skip" with "read.table" to ignore this extra information. 
# You may also need to set "header=TRUE" explicitly.  


#############################
# 5) Divide the population data by the population change (decreasing, increasing). 
#
# Before you find out the right answers to the following questions by examining the data, 
# create a hypothesis: what do you think the answers will be?
#
# Are there more municipalities with increasing population than with decreasing population? 
#
# Are municipalities with increasing population larger than those with decreasing population?

############################
# 6) What is the correlation of the population change of males and females?


############################
# 7) Are there municipalities into which women are moving and from which men are moving out? What about the opposite,
# are there municipalities into which men are moving and from which women are moving out?
